## Black Thursday

Find the [project spec here](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/black_thursday.markdown).

Black Thursday was the final project for module 1 of the Back End Engineering program at the Turing School. This project introduced us to ORM and had us build one, in preparation for diving into ActiveRecord in module 2. There are many methods located on the sales_analyst.rb and merchant_analyzer.rb files that allow the user to execute business intelligence queries on the set of Etsy data that is loaded.
